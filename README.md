# FairHTEforCENSORED
This is the code for paper titled 'Advancing fairness for treatment strategy estimation on censored data' on AISTATS2025.

descripation:

**utils.R**: Implements a fair and robust estimator for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE).

**ITR-covgpsmatch-funcs.R**: Provides functions for imputing censored data.

**simu_fair.R:** This script conducts simulation experiments to estimate the fair conditional average treatment effect (CATE) on synthetic data.

 **fairACTG.R:** This script applies the fair CATE estimation method to the ACTG dataset.
 
**fairHCC.R:** This script applies the fair CATE estimation method to the HCC dataset.
