# FairHTEforCENSORED
> This repository contains the code for the paper *"Advancing Fairness in Precision Medicine: A Universal Framework for Optimal Treatment Estimation in Censored Data"*, which will be presented at AISTATS2025. 

This repository includes the following components:

**utils.R**: Implements a fair and robust estimator for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE).

**ITR-covgpsmatch-funcs.R**: Provides functions for imputing censored data.

**simu_fair.R:** This script conducts simulation experiments to estimate the fair conditional average treatment effect (CATE) on synthetic data.

 **fairACTG.R:** This script applies the fair CATE estimation method to the ACTG dataset.
 
**fairHCC.R:** This script applies the fair CATE estimation method to the HCC dataset.
